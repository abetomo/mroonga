(release-15-00)=
## Release 15.00 - 2025-02-09

This is our annual major release! This release doesn't have any
backward incompatible changes! So you can upgrade Mroonga without
migrating your existing databases. You can still use your existing
databases as-is.

### Improvements

#### {ref}`server-variable-mroonga-n-workers`: Added support for parallel execution

[GH-877](https://github.com/mroonga/mroonga/issues/877)

You can set concurrency in Groonga by
{ref}`server-variable-mroonga-n-workers`. Some operations such as
`CREATE INDEX` refer this server variable. You can use this to
improve performance by using multiple CPU cores.

In general, you should set this in `my.cnf` not `SET`. Because this
doesn't change concurrency in the current session (at least for
now). If you want to change this by `SET`, you need to set by `SET
GLOBAL` and re-connect to MySQL.

#### MariaDB: Added support for MariaDB 10.5.28, 10.6.21, 10.11.11 and 11.4.5

You can use Mroonga with the latest MariaDB releases.

### Fixes

#### {doc}`/tutorial/wrapper`: Fixed a bug that wrapped engine's index information may not be used correctly

[GH-634](https://github.com/mroonga/mroonga/issues/634)

If wrapped engine's index information isn't used correctly, MariaDB
may not be able to use suitable index. It may cause a poor performance
query execution.
